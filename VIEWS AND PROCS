/*
A summary of how many buses are assigned to each bus barn
A schedule for a particular bus (do this as a stored procedure where the buskey can be passed as a parameter. This will simply be a schedule of the stops not the times since somehow that table didn't get populated.)
The total revenues per city per year
The total cost of buses by Bus type
The total revenues per year
The count of employees by position
The total amount earned by a driver in a year (make it a stored procedure and pass in year and driverKey as parameters)
The cost of a bus versus the amount of fares earned by that bus across the three years. (Does the bus pay for itself) pass in the buskey as a parameter.
